# Infrastructure_P1

Problem Statement:
My client has an EC2 instance on AWS where both the frontend and backend code, along with the web server, are hosted on the same machine. 
While this setup initially works well, as the number of users increases, the infrastructure slows down due to resource exhaustion on the EC2 instance. 
The client now requires a scalable and secure architecture to support their growing product demands.
